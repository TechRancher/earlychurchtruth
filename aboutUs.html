              <article><h2>About Us</h2>
              <p>We love Him because He first loved us and because we have tasted this love we are able to express it one to another. Jesus said that by this we would be known as His disciples. Therefore this "faith once delivered to the saints" is not held so much in a rigidness of dogma but as simply the life and practice of those who are of "The Way". We hold to the basic tenets of Christianity as stated in the Apostle's Creed. The foundation for this is Christ's teaching in the Sermon on the Mount and throughout the gospels. Those things are given in express clarity we hold as foundationally essential to the Christian Church, among which are loving your enemies, fidelity in marriage, laying up treasures in heaven rather than on earth, and speaking the truth with no need for swearing. Further, those applications given by the Apostles in the New Testament letters are viewed as accompaniments to the gospel teaching such as modesty, propriety, headship order, the veiling of women, order in the assembly, the recognition and appointment of leaders, etc. Fellowship and communion are offered to any who hold to these simple truths. The more detailed and defined applications are left to the individual. Council and direction may be given but the reception of these is not the gauge of our fellowship. Each of the brethren is to work out their own salvation with fear and trembling as together we endeavor to fulfill the new commandment given of the Lord, "That ye love one another".</p></article>

            <h5>Early Church</h5>
            <p>The early church did not swear allegiance to any other kingdom, did not go to war, did not sue their enemies, did not allow divorce and remarriage, did not seek after wealth. The men were the head of the home and wore beards. The women learned to submit, dressed modestly and covered their heads. They did not worry about doctrines of theology; they believed Christ and followed him. They were not a denomination; they were simply people who came out of the world and FOLLOWED Jesus Christ.</p>
